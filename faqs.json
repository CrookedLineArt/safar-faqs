You may be charged a cancellation fee if any one of the following occurs: (a) where:(i) the estimated time of arrival of the driver is less than 5 minutes and you cancel the booking 3 minutes or later after the booking has been accepted by the driver, or(ii) the estimated time of arrival of the driver is 5 minutes or more and you cancel the booking 5 minutes or later after the booking has been accepted by the driver, or(b) a driver has already arrived at your pickup location, or(c) a driver cancels the booking after waiting at your pickup location for 5 minutes or more, or(d) canceling an Ola Share ride 2 minutes or later after making a booking. However, the cancellation fee will not be charged if the driver is delayed in reaching the picking up location by more than 5 minutes from the shown estimated time of arrival. The cancellation fee amount may vary depending on your city, and the vehicle category selected. A cancellation fee, if charged, will be added to the total bill amount of your next Ola ride.",

            "question": "What is peak pricing?",
            "answer": "Peak Pricing is an additional charge applicable when the demand for cabs is higher than the number of cabs actually available near your location. A variety of factors such as office rush hours, heavy rain , holiday or a local event can cause rise in demand for cabs which may result in peak pricing being applied on your ride. Peak pricing is not a fixed charge and varies depending on the demand for cabs. For example- If the peak pricing applicable on your booking is 1.2x then your total fare will increase by 1.2 times. In some cities, during high demand time, revised total fare will be shown for your ride before you confirm a booking. We at Ola believe in transparent pricing. You will always be informed if peak pricing is applicable on your ride before you confirm a booking. If you feel that the peak pricing applied on your ride is high, you can try choosing from other cab categories available on the Safar Car Rental or or alternately try booking a cab from your Safar Car Rental after a few minutes.",
